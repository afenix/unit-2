# Geog 575 Course Repository: Activity 6 - Portland Vandal Map

Welcome to the dedicated repository for Activity 5 of the Geog 575 course. This segment of the course focuses on creating an interactive Leaflet map exploring vandalism in Portland, Oregon over the past 9 years. The repository contains all materials and developments related to the Leaflet tutorials and the vandal geojson dataset.

## Project Overview

This project is designed to further our understanding and skills in geovisualization through the creation of an interactive Leaflet map. The map highlights vandalism from 2015 to 2023 summarized by neighborhoods in Portland, Oregon.

## Files

The repository is structured with the following key files:

- `main.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic for initializing the Leaflet map, loading geoJSON data, and managing interactive features such as custom popups based on map points.
- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the project, hosting the Leaflet map and providing structure for the interactive elements and informational content.
- `style.css`: Applies custom styles to the Leaflet map and webpage elements, enhancing the visual appeal and usability of the project.
- `crime15_23.geojson`: A GeoJSON file containing data on vandalism, as well as violent and non-violent crimes, summarized by Portland neighborhoods for the years 2015-2023. The data was obtained from the Portland Police Bureau ([View Source](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/portlandpolicebureau/viz/New_Monthly_Neighborhood/MonthlyOffenseTotals)) and subsequently processed by the author to fulfill the requirements for this lab's interactive mapping criteria.


## How to Run

To interact with the interactive queer history map:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local environment.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser to launch the project.
3. If data is available, click on map points to reveal popups with information about historical locations and events.

## Project Features

- **Interactive Map**: Utilizes Leaflet to offer a dynamic exploration of queer historical sites.
- **Data-Driven Visualizations**: Each point on the map is derived from the `crime15_23.geojson` dataset, representing summarized locations of vandalism in Portland, OR from 2015-2023.
- **Educational Tool**: Serves as a resource for academic research and educational purposes, emphasizing the provisional nature of the data and inviting contributions for accuracy and depth.

## Course Information

**GEOG575: Interactive Cartography & Geovisualization**

This course activity contributes to our comprehensive exploration of interactive mapping and geovisualization techniques. In Activity 5, we delve into the practical application of these skills and how we can build on them to craft an interactive map that allows users to navigate and understand spatio-temporal data.
