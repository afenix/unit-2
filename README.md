# Geog 575 Course Repository: Activity 5 - Leaflet Queer History Map

Welcome to the dedicated repository for Activity 5 of the Geog 575 course. This segment of the course focuses on creating an interactive Leaflet map exploring queer history. The repository contains all materials and developments related to the Leaflet tutorials and the queer history lab dataset.

## Project Overview

This project is designed to further our understanding and skills in geovisualization through the creation of an interactive Leaflet map. The map highlights significant locations and events in queer history over the past century (created by author), using geoJSON data to represent these spatially and temporally.

NOTE: This repository offers tools for geospatial analysis, excluding the sensitive GeoJSON data to prevent misuse. For data access, contact me at alister.fenix@way-find.com, detailing your usage intentions and audience.

Meanwhile, you're invited to explore the code, enhance documentation, or provide feedback. Your involvement is valuable for the project's growth and ethical use, even without the data.

## Files

The repository is structured with the following key files:

- `main.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic for initializing the Leaflet map, loading geoJSON data, and managing interactive features such as custom popups based on map points.
- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the project, hosting the Leaflet map and providing structure for the interactive elements and informational content.
- `style.css`: Applies custom styles to the Leaflet map and webpage elements, enhancing the visual appeal and usability of the project.
- `QPDX.geojson`(NOT INCLUDED): A geoJSON file with data on important queer historical locations, including names, dates, descriptions, and coordinates. Contact the author to request permission on accessing this file.

## How to Run

To interact with the interactive queer history map:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local environment.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser to launch the project.
3. If data is available, click on map points to reveal popups with information about historical locations and events.

## Project Features

- **Interactive Map**: Utilizes Leaflet to offer a dynamic exploration of queer historical sites.
- **Data-Driven Visualizations**: Each point on the map is derived from the `QPDX.geojson` dataset, representing significant events and locations.
- **Educational Tool**: Serves as a resource for academic research and educational purposes, emphasizing the provisional nature of the data and inviting contributions for accuracy and depth.

## Course Information

**GEOG575: Interactive Cartography & Geovisualization**

This course activity contributes to our comprehensive exploration of interactive mapping and geovisualization techniques. In Activity 5, we delve into the practical application of these skills and how we can build on them to craft an interactive map that allows users to navigate and understand spatio-temporal data.
