Map enhancement ideas:

** Complementary data sets: **
1. Find yearly funding for graffiti in PDX - how effective is the anti-graffiti department?
    a. show the year that the funding for anti-graffiti was cut in the slider
2. Add Neighborhood boundaries
    a. create a cloropleth map showing same data for each neighborhood
3. Demographics = Median income of neighborhood (categorized) / population / work (basically, explore WHY certain neighborhoods have more graffit than others)
    a. % of households with kids below the poverty level
    b.
4. Look at Graffiti data: https://www.portland.gov/bps/graffiti

** Map styling: **
1. Make orange circles styled like spray paint
2. Add label over circle for # of events
3. Change color of - to reflect if there is % change over year is +/- (+ darker color/- lighter color)
4. Add option for viewers to change to cloropleth map by neighborhood (perhaps include both?)
